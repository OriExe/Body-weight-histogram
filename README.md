# Body Weight Histogram
My programming coursework I've made in my first year, I was tasked to make a program that would show a histogram of all the customers who entered the store today. The user enters the body weight of each customer and the program will show a histogram including every customer represented as a $ who will be put in a group with people in the same range as them
